(** * Classic list functions *)

(* The trio of "map/filter/reduce" are commonly presented as workhorse
 * *higher-order functions* for lists.  That is, they are functions that take
 * functions as arguments. *)

(* [map] runs a function on every position of a list to make a new list. *)
Fixpoint map {A B} (f : A -> B) (ls : list A) : list B :=
  match ls with
  | nil => nil
  | x :: ls' => f x :: map f ls'
  end.

Compute map (fun n => n + 2) [1; 3; 8].
(* Note the use of an *anonymous function* above via [fun]. *)

(* [filter] keeps only those elements of a list that pass a Boolean test. *)
Fixpoint filter {A} (f : A -> bool) (ls : list A) : list A :=
  match ls with
  | nil => nil
  | x :: ls' => if f x then x :: filter f ls' else filter f ls'
  end.

Compute filter (fun n => if n <=? 3 then true else false) [1; 3; 8].
(* The [if ... then true else false] bit might seem wasteful.  Actually, the
 * [<=?] operator has a fancy type that needs converting to [bool].  We'll get
 * more specific about such types in a future class. *)

(* [fold_left], a relative of "reduce," repeatedly applies a function to all
 * elements of a list. *)
Fixpoint fold_left {A B} (f : B -> A -> B) (ls : list A) (acc : B) : B :=
  match ls with
  | nil => acc
  | x :: ls' => fold_left f ls' (f acc x)
  end.

Compute fold_left max [1; 3; 8] 0.

(* Another way to see [fold_left] in action: *)
Theorem fold_left3 : forall {A B} (f : B -> A -> B) (x y z : A) (acc : B),
    fold_left f [x; y; z] acc = f (f (f acc x) y) z.
Proof.
  simplify.
  equality.
Qed.

(* Let's use these classics to implement a few simple "database queries" on the
 * list of programming languages.  Note that each field name from
 * [programming_language] is itself a first-class function, for projecting that
 * field from any record! *)

Compute map Name languages.
(* names of languages *)

Compute map Name (filter PurelyFunctional languages).
(* names of purely functional languages *)

Compute fold_left max (map AppearedInYear languages) 0.
(* maximum year in which a language appeared *)

Compute fold_left max (map AppearedInYear (filter PurelyFunctional languages)) 0.
(* maximum year in which a purely functional language appeared *)

(* To avoid confusing things, we'll revert to the standard library's (identical)
 * versions of these functions for the remainder. *)
Reset map.


(** * Sorting, parameterized in a comparison operation *)

(* Another classic family of higher-order functions is for sorting, where we
 * typically take a *comparator* as input.  Such a function helps us compare
 * data elements with each other.  Let's do insertion sort as an example. *)

(* Important helper function: take in an assumed-sorted list [ls]; generate a
 * new list that is like [ls] but with [new] inserted at the appropriate
 * position to maintain sortedness.  We use "less than or equal to" test [le] to
 * define sortedness. *)
Fixpoint insert {A} (le : A -> A -> bool) (new : A) (ls : list A) : list A :=
  match ls with
  | [] => [new]
  | x :: ls' =>
    if le new x then
      new :: ls
    else
      x :: insert le new ls'
  end.

(* Now insertion sort is just repeated use of [insert]. *)
Fixpoint insertion_sort {A} (le : A -> A -> bool) (ls : list A) : list A :=
  match ls with
  | [] => []
  | x :: ls' => insert le x (insertion_sort le ls')
  end.

(* To help us state our main theorem, we define sortedness. *)
Fixpoint sorted {A} (le : A -> A -> bool) (ls : list A) : bool :=
  match ls with
  | [] => true
  | x1 :: ls' =>
    match ls' with
    | x2 :: _ => le x1 x2 && sorted le ls'
    | [] => true
    end
  end.

(* [insert] preserves sortedness.  Note the crucial hypothesis that comparator
 * [le] is *total*: any two elements are related by it, in one order or the
 * other. *)
Lemma insert_sorted : forall {A} (le : A -> A -> bool) a,
    (forall x y, le x y = false -> le y x = true)
    -> forall ls, sorted le ls = true
                  -> sorted le (insert le a ls) = true.

    (forall x y, le x y = false -> le y x = true)
    -> forall ls,
      sorted le (insertion_sort le ls) = true.
Proof.
  induct ls; simplify; trivial.
  apply insert_sorted; trivial.
Qed.

(* The other classic requirement of a sorting function is that it return a
 * permutation of its input, but we will skip that element here, since it is
 * orthogonal to practicing with higher-order functions. *)

(* Let's do a quick example of using [insertion_sort] with a concrete
 * comparator. *)

Definition not_introduced_later (l1 l2 : programming_language) : bool :=
  if AppearedInYear l1 <=? AppearedInYear l2 then true else false.

Compute insertion_sort

(** * A language of functions and its interpreter *)

(* Let's now work through an example of a language and its interpreter.
 * Specifically, we'll define a language of first-class functions and
 * higher-order functions.  It would be natural to make our language statically
 * typed, but it turns out we need a bit more Coq sophistication to implement a
 * proper interpreter for such an embedded language, which we'll postpone for
 * module DependentInductiveTypes.  Instead, here's a simple "universal type"
 * along the lines of dynamically typed languages like Python. *)
Inductive dyn :=
| Bool (b : bool)
| Number (n : nat)
| List (ds : list dyn).

(* Next, we implement dynamic versions of a few handy library functions.
 * Notice that they have arbitrary default behavior when passed improperly typed
 * arguments. *)

Definition dmap (f : dyn -> dyn) (x : dyn) : dyn :=

  | Number _ => Bool false
  | _ => x
  end.

Definition dnot (x : dyn) : dyn :=

  | Bool b => Bool (negb b)
  | x => x
  end.

(* Here's our syntax-tree type for functions (transformations). *)
Inductive xform :=

| Map (xf1 : xform)
| Filter (xf1 : xform)

(* And here's our simple interpreter. *)
Fixpoint transform (xf : xform) : dyn -> dyn :=

  | Map f => dmap (transform f)
  | Filter f => dfilter (transform f)

  | ConstantBool b => fun _ => Bool b
  | ConstantNumber n => fun _ => Number n
  | IsZero => disZero
  | Not => dnot
  end.

Compute transform (Map IsZero) (List [Number 0; Number 1; Number 2; Number 0; Number 3]).
Compute transform (Filter IsZero) (List [Number 0; Number 1; Number 2; Number 0; Number 3]).

(* Here's a grab bag of optimizations of our programs. *)
Fixpoint optimize (xf : xform) : xform :=
  match xf with
  | Compose xf1 xf2 =>
    match optimize xf1, optimize xf2 with
